# Exploratory-Analysis-of-Geo-locational-Data
This project aims to optimize student accommodation and strategically locate amenities for students in Pune using data-driven techniques. By leveraging K-Means Clustering and preference analysis, we preprocess real-life datasets on student accommodations, amenities, budgets, and food outlets to identify optimal accommodation areas that meet students' preferences. Additionally, a survey is conducted to gather insights into students' food preferences and dining habits. The project utilizes Object-Oriented Programming principles, Python libraries for data visualization, and REST APIs for data collection. The clustering results and preference analysis provide actionable recommendations for students seeking accommodations and for businesses looking to strategically place outlets near student populations. The outcomes of this project enhance student satisfaction and convenience while offering a versatile methodology that can be applied to other cities for data-driven decision-making.
